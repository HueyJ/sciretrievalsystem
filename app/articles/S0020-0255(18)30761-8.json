This paper explores information structures in a covering information system, and this kind of structure is viewed as a granular structure from the granular computing viewpoint. The concept of information structures in a covering information system is first described by means of set vectors. Then, relationships between information structures in a covering information system are studied from the two aspects of dependence and separation. Next, properties of information structures in a covering information system are given. Furthermore, invariant characterizations of covering information systems under homomorphisms are presented. Finally, as an application for information structures in a covering information system, the granularity measure of uncertainty for covering information systems is investigated. These results will be very helpful for establishing a framework for granular computing in information systems.", "openaccess": "0", "subject": "Covering information system, Information granule, Information structure, Dependence, Information distance, Inclusion degree, Information granularity, Characterization;", "href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025518307618"}
