Munro, Yair Wand;", "abstract": "Information Requirements Analysis deals with defining the information needed for managerial purposes. It is considered as the first step of analysis in the development of an information system. This paper ties information requirements analysis with information evaluation. It is asserted that it is insufficient to simply find \u201cneeded\u201d information items but also that such items should be evaluated in terms of their benefit.Three approaches to information evaluation are considered \u2014 realistic, normative and subjective. It is asserted that the normative approach may sometimes be applied in lower organizational levels, while at higher levels subjective evaluation is used. Some examples are discussed in this context. Finally, we discuss some procedures for applying evaluation in information analysis.", "openaccess": "0", "subject": "Information Evaluation, Information Requirements Analysis, Value of Information;", "href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378720681900410"}
