Information independence is proposed as a major architectural characteristic underlying many desirable features. Two types of information independence are identified and an approach to quantifying the degree of independence is introduced. Information independence is suggested as a useful and quantifiable measure of the value of an information system.", "openaccess": "0", "subject": "Information System, System Evaluation, System Architecture, Information Independence;", "href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378720683900393"}
