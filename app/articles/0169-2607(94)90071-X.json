Griffin, Grant A. Vidgen, John B. Hepworth;", "abstract": "A research project funded by the Welsh Office and undertaken by the Department of Information and Library Studies, University of Wales, Aberystwyth examined the information systems in place in a sample of general medical practices in Wales. Shortcomings were identified in patient records, the supply of medical information for patients, staff training and staff communications. Practices lacked coherent information management strategies to relate information to practice goals and to define responsibility and protocols for information tasks. Unless rectified, these deficiencies will inhibit the viability of primary care data as a basis for medical research, audit and for identifying the health needs of communities.", "openaccess": "0", "subject": "Information management, Primary care, Information systems, Information strategy;", "href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016926079490071X"}
