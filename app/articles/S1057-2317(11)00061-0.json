It attempted to seek answers to questions such as how search for information is initiated, what information sources are preferred and how successful is information finding? Journalists were asked to report critical incidences of information finding related to their recent journalistic assignment through a questionnaire. Analysis of 42 critical incidents indicated that journalistic assignments were in four major areas: political, cultural business, and sports. In most cases, background information was most frequently sought type of information. Internet was the most frequently used information source even though some journalists perceived that information available on the various websites may not be very objective. A follow up study is planned to be carried out to discuss the findings with a selected group of journalists using focus group discussions.", "openaccess": "0", "subject": "Information behavior, Information needs, Information seeking, Journalists, Critical incident method;", "href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057231711000610"}
