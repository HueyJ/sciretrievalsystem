Surveys were sent at four months post partum.Findingsforty-seven per cent (350/752) of eligible women returned the surveys, of whom 62% were primiparous. \u2018Discussion with a midwife\u2019 was the source of information used by the greatest number of women during pregnancy (246/350, 70%). Less than half of the women used the internet to access information (154/350, 44%), and group information sessions were the least preferred information format (8/330, 2.4%). Women from non-English speaking backgrounds (NESB) were less likely to use written and online resources. One-third of the women had unmet learning needs, particularly in relation to breast feeding and postnatal recovery. Overall, women rated books as the most useful source of information (57/332, 17.2%). The model of pregnancy care influenced the source women rated as most useful. Women who received most of their pregnancy care from a midwife described discussion with a midwife as their most useful source of information (42/150, 28%). In contrast, of the group who received most of their care from a doctor in antenatal clinic, the largest proportion reported that the internet was their most useful source of information (10/57, 28%).Conclusion and recommendationsdiscussion with midwives is an important source of information for women. The internet did not play a significant role in information seeking for more than half of the women in the study. Existing sources of information may not meet the needs of women from NESB, either because women do not access the multilingual resources currently available or because resources may only be provided in English or a few other common languages.", "openaccess": "0", "subject": "Information, Pregnancy, Internet, Information seeking;", "href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266613813002994"}
