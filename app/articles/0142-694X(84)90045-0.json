Parallel concerns exist in design research, and are as important as they are topical. Questions about the integration and application of knowledge to design begin in design education and continue in design practice. In this paper we discuss these assertions and review some of the research that has been conducted in the area with reference to building design. We go on to question whether the research is correctly focused, and conclude by emphasizing that the initiative for studies of information in design will come only from the research community.", "openaccess": "0", "subject": "Design information, information transfer, research;", "href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0142694X84900450"}
